## Overview
This is a project for the course Operations Research 2 taken by prof. Matteo Fischetti in the a.y. 2020/2021

This project focuses on solving TSPs with different algorithms

## Download

You can download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/deno750/TSP_Optimization/releases/latest)

## Structure

Here we describe how this project is organized:
 - **build** is a generated folder by cmake which contains all the files needed for building the project and its executable
 - **data** folder contains the *.tsp* files
 - **docs** contains the documentation of the data formatting taken from TSLIB
 - **include** contains the *.h* files of the project
 - **libs** contains the third pary libraries utilized in this project.If it's not present, create it
 - **logs** is a generated folder when a method which uses CPLEX is utilized. It contains the CPLEX's log files
 - **results** contains the performance profile experiments saved in *.csv* files and some comparison charts saved in *.pdf* files
 - **model** is a generated folder which contains *.lp* files generated by CPLEX
 - **other_codes** contains some python scripts which are useful for performance profiles etc
 - **plot** contains the solved plots of the problems
 - **src** contains the source files of the project
 - **test** not used
 - **tour** is a generated folder which saves the *.tour* files in TSPLIB format. Those files contain the information of the problem's solution



## Installation
To compile this repository, Cplex and Concorde are required. To install Cplex you can follow IBM's [guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/12.7.1.0?topic=v1271-installing-cplex-optimization-studio).

To install Concorde, follow the following steps:
- Download Concorde's zipped tar file from [here](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/downloads/downloads.htm)
- Extract it in the *libs* folder. You should now have *libs/concorde*. Note if the *libs* folder is not present, create it
- Now using terminal type `cd libs/concorde`
- Now type `./configure`. If you're MacOS user, type `./configure --host=darwin`
- When the latest comand finishes, type `make` to conclude the installation

If you want details on how to install concorde, check this [guide](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/DOC/README.html)

When all the requirements are satisfied, you can finally compile the project. 
Once you have configured the the project with CMake based on your IDE and environment, to compile the project you have to go in *build* folder typing `cd build` and type `make`.

## Usage
The input data is given [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/tsp)
The format is described in [tsp95.pdf](/docs/tsp95.pdf)

To run the program, inside the *build* folder, type `./tsp`. 
To see all the command line options, use `./tsp --help`.
To see the list of the methods available, use `./tsp --methods`.

An example of usage is: `./tsp -f ../data/att48.tsp -method GG -t 300 -verbose 4`

To plot the TSP solution in a png file, [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info) must be installed. You can install it from your OS repository such as `apt install gnuplot` on ubuntu or `brew install gnuplot` on MacOS.

If you're on windows, use Windows Subsistem for Linux (WSL). The native compatibility on windows is not supported
